# Mobile Testing Guide for OpenDev Triage

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Pre-Testing Requirements

### 1. Bundle Identifier Issue (MUST FIX FIRST!)
Your bundle identifiers are mismatched between configuration files:
- **app.json**: `com.opendevtriage.app`
- **iOS (GoogleService-Info.plist)**: `com.Sid.OpenDevTriage`
- **Android (google-services.json)**: `com.OpenDevTriage.app`

**Choose ONE bundle identifier and update everywhere:**

Option A: Use `com.opendevtriage.app` (recommended)
- Update Firebase console to generate new `GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services.json` with this bundle ID
- Or update `app.json` to match existing Firebase config

Option B: Use existing Firebase bundle IDs
- Update `app.json` iOS bundleIdentifier to `com.Sid.OpenDevTriage`
- Update `app.json` Android package to `com.OpenDevTriage.app`

### 2. n8n Webhook URL for Mobile Testing

**Problem**: `localhost:5678` doesn't work on mobile devices

**Solution Options**:

#### Option A: Use ngrok (Recommended for Testing)
1. Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Start your n8n instance: (make sure it's running)
3. In a new terminal, run:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 5678
   ```
4. Copy the HTTPS URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)
5. Update `.env`:
   ```
   EXPO_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/webhook/OpenDev_Triage
   ```

#### Option B: Deploy n8n to Cloud
Deploy to services like:
- Railway (https://railway.app)
- Render (https://render.com)
- DigitalOcean App Platform
- Heroku

## üì± Testing on iOS

### Prerequisites
- Mac computer with Xcode installed
- iOS device OR iOS Simulator
- Expo Go app installed (for quick testing) OR ability to create development build

### Method 1: Expo Go (Quick Testing)
**Note**: Expo Go has limitations with Google Sign-In due to custom native modules.

1. Install Expo Go on your iOS device from App Store
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   # or if on physical device:
   npm start
   ```
3. Scan the QR code with your iPhone camera
4. App will open in Expo Go

**Limitation**: Google OAuth may not work fully in Expo Go. Use Method 2 for full testing.

### Method 2: Development Build (Full Testing - RECOMMENDED)
This creates a standalone app with all native features.

1. Install EAS CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install -g eas-cli
   ```

2. Login to Expo:
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```

3. Configure EAS:
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```

4. Create iOS development build:
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform ios
   ```

5. Install on device or simulator:
   - For device: Download IPA and install via Xcode or Apple Configurator
   - For simulator: Use the provided simulator URL

6. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start --dev-client
   ```

### Testing Checklist - iOS

- [ ] Google sign-in popup opens
- [ ] After sign-in, user profile is visible
- [ ] "Connect GitHub Account" button appears after Google sign-in
- [ ] Can select a repository
- [ ] Can trigger analysis (requires n8n URL to be accessible)
- [ ] Analysis results display correctly
- [ ] Can view analysis history
- [ ] Profile screen shows user info

## ü§ñ Testing on Android

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed
- Android device with USB debugging enabled OR Android Emulator
- Expo Go app (for quick testing) OR ability to create development build

### Method 1: Expo Go (Quick Testing)

1. Install Expo Go from Google Play Store
2. Enable USB debugging on Android device
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run android
   ```
4. Scan QR code in Expo Go app

**Limitation**: Google OAuth may not work fully in Expo Go. Use Method 2 for full testing.

### Method 2: Development Build (Full Testing - RECOMMENDED)

1. Create Android development build:
   ```bash
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

2. Install APK on device:
   - Download APK from EAS build page
   - Install on device or emulator
   - Or use: `adb install path/to/app.apk`

3. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm start --dev-client
   ```

### Testing Checklist - Android
- [ ] App launches successfully
- [ ] "Sign in with Google" button appears
- [ ] Google sign-in popup opens
- [ ] After sign-in, user profile is visible
- [ ] "Connect GitHub Account" button appears after Google sign-in
- [ ] Can select a repository
- [ ] Can trigger analysis (requires n8n URL to be accessible)
- [ ] Analysis results display correctly
- [ ] Can view analysis history
- [ ] Profile screen shows user info

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Google Sign-In Not Working

**iOS Issues:**
1. Verify `GoogleService-Info.plist` is present
2. Check bundle identifier matches Firebase console
3. Ensure iOS Client ID is correct in `.env`
4. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Sign-in method ‚Üí Google is enabled

**Android Issues:**
1. Verify `google-services.json` is present
2. Check package name matches Firebase console
3. Ensure Android Client ID is correct in `.env`
4. Get SHA-1 fingerprint and add to Firebase:
   ```bash
   # For debug build:
   cd android
   ./gradlew signingReport
   ```
5. Add SHA-1 to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Your Android app

### n8n Connection Failing

**Error**: "Cannot connect to n8n"
- **Solution**: Make sure n8n URL is accessible from mobile device (use ngrok or cloud deployment)

**Error**: "n8n webhook not found"
- **Solution**: Verify webhook endpoint is active in n8n workflow

**Error**: "Network request failed"
- **Solution**: Check if mobile device can access the n8n URL (try opening in mobile browser)

### Build Errors

**Error**: "Bundle identifier mismatch"
- **Solution**: Update all config files to use same bundle identifier

**Error**: "Module not found: expo-auth-session"
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Fix bundle identifier mismatch
2. ‚úÖ Set up ngrok for n8n (or deploy to cloud)
3. ‚úÖ Update `.env` with ngrok URL
4. ‚úÖ Create iOS development build with EAS
5. ‚úÖ Create Android development build with EAS
6. ‚úÖ Test on both platforms
7. ‚úÖ Document any issues found
8. ‚úÖ Fix issues and retest

## üìù Notes

- **Expo Go limitations**: Full native features (like proper Google OAuth) require development builds
- **Network accessibility**: Mobile devices need network-accessible URLs (not localhost)
- **Firebase configuration**: Ensure all bundle identifiers and package names match
- **Testing frequency**: Test on both iOS and Android before major releases
